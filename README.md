# BLOOD DONATION SYSTEM

A C++ program has been designed so as to implement blood donation system in a very small scale.
There are four classes,namely 
1. blood_bank, 
2. admin, 
3. donor and 
4. patient.

The blood bank class contains an array of static int variable named blood group which stores the number of packets available in each blood group currently.
The Administrators can see the number of packets of blood available for each blood group through the admin class by entering the password.
Donors can login to enter their details and can donate any number of blood packets while patients can login and borrow 1 packet at a time.
